# Next.js API Route: Silent Failure on Empty/Malformed Request Body

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js API routes where errors related to accessing the request body are not properly handled.  When the request body is empty or malformed, the API route fails silently, returning a generic 500 Internal Server Error instead of a more informative and specific error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

## Bug

The `pages/api/hello.js` file contains a Next.js API route that attempts to access data from the request body.  If the request body is missing or contains invalid data, the route does not catch the error appropriately, leading to the server error.

## Solution

The solution in `pages/api/hello.js` adds comprehensive error handling to address the issue.  It explicitly checks for missing request data and handles any parsing exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
